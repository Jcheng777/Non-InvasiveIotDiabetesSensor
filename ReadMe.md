## IoT Device for Blood Glucose Monitoring via Exhaled Breath

## Abstract
Medical records illustrate that type 1 diabetes mellitus is a major health issue. 2.6 million adults age 18 years and above are living with type 1 diabetes, experiencing serious complications due to fluctuations of blood glucose levels. The goal is to utilize acetone within breath to help monitor diabetic patients as it has a negative correlation with blood glucose. Through the creation of an IoT device assembled with low cost materials it can provide (i) a non-invasive solution without the use of painful methods e.g. pricking; (ii) data, which is stored in the cloud allowing for independent monitoring as well as alerting doctors from medical institutions. Sensors were calibrated against known concentrations of acetone to test the device. Results indicate the potential of a sensitive IoT device for blood glucose monitoring.
